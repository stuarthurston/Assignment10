In order for this program to run properly 4 files (in addition to the images) are required

-- War.java

-- Player.java

-- Deck.java

-- Card.java

-- bigImages (folder)




The documentation folder contains HTML files with the JAVA docs

Also, I have 5 bonus points from something! Could they be applied to an assignment where I lost points?
